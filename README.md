# Power BI + AI Forecasting Project

This project demonstrates how to apply machine learning for sales forecasting and explainability within a Power BI reporting environment. It is designed to serve as a public portfolio project and a learning resource for data professionals interested in combining advanced analytics with business intelligence.

## 🔍 Project Overview

We simulate a real-world sales dataset and apply forecasting techniques using Python (scikit-learn), along with visual explanations of model outputs. The final output is delivered through an interactive Power BI report.
